            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The Town is governed by 2 Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liffs, 2 Ceronets, 4 Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains, and 36 Burgeſſes, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of 3 Benches annually cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, dignifyed with a right of electing two Repreſentatives in <hi>Parliament.</hi> It is fortifyed on the North-eaſt with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding high and inacceſſible Rock, which ſtretches it ſelf at good diſtance into the Sea, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining about 18 or 20 Acres of

The top of the

The other is a ſpring of freſh Water, within half a yard of the edge of the Rock towards the Sea, which in the moſt droughty Summers never wanted water, and was of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular

               </gap>own of <hi>Hull,</hi> among whom I lived and managed my profeſſion near eighteen years, obſerving very much the operation and effects of this water, but alſo it hath of late years been well known to the Citizens of <hi>York,</hi> and the Gentry of the County, who do conſtantly frequent it; yea and to ſeverall perſons of quallity in the Nation, who upon the large commendations of ſuch as knew its opperrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, have made triall of it, with whom it hath gained ſuch cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:116020:13"/>that they come above an hundred miles to drink of it, preferring it before all other medicinal waters they had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly frequented. Nay, I have met with ſome that had been at the <hi>Germane Spaws,</hi> both at <hi>Sauvenir</hi> and <hi>Ponhout,</hi> who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer this for its ſpeedy paſſage both by ſeige and urine before them.</p>
            <p>I having had a large oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity for twenty 2. years laſt paſt, to obſerve the effects of this medicinall ſpring, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in my ſelfe, but very many others, whom I have known to drink of it in various caſes; I ſhall for the further benefit of my Country make out my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, and will therefore firſt treat concerning its parts,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:116020:13"/>and of what Mineralls it doth participate, with the nature of them, and then deſcend to its vertues and effects.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith, there are two things that do neceſſarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur to the finding out of Arts and Sciences,<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>2.</hi> de Simp. med. fac.</note> or any ſimple Medicine, <hi>vid. Experience</hi> and <hi>Reaſon;</hi> From whence did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe two Sects of Phyſicians in his days, <hi>Empiricks</hi> and <hi>Metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſts:</hi> The former obſerved the operation of Medicines, not troubling themſelves to pry into the nature of them, to find out the reaſon of thoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations, and were wont to uſe them promiſcuouſly whom therefore he frequently chides, and charges of folly. The other though they had found out the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:116020:14"/>virtue of a Medicine, yet were not ſatisfied with the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, but proceeded to the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, diving into the nature of it, that they might know from whence it had its virtue, &amp; conſequently the reaſon of its working. Theſe he calls the two leggs of a Phyſician upon which hee ought to walk; and further adds, that he that would hope to attain to any competent perfection in the <hi>Art of Phyſick,</hi> muſt take care to uſe them both. My deſign ſhall bee to follow his advice as well as I may, and ſo to let the Reader know, that <hi>Experience</hi> hath found out that this Medicinall Spring doth work exceeding well both by ſeige and urine, and that it is found to bee effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:116020:14"/>in all diſeaſes that require ſuch evacuations.</p>
            <p>But becauſe I would not have the ingenious to Content him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with this experime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cal noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, let him know that this water hath it's virtue from it's parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of <hi>Vitriol, Iron, allome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Its. Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls</note> 
               <hi>Nitre</hi> and <hi>Salt:</hi> the natures of which Mineralls I ſhall enquire into anon.</p>
            <p>It is very tranſparent to the ſight, inclining ſomewhat to a Skey colour,<note place="margin">As qualities</note> it hath a pleaſant acid taſte from the <hi>Vitriol,</hi> and an inky ſmell.</p>
            <p>If an equall quantity of boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling milk be put to it, it coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates it, as do the <hi>Germane Spaws,</hi> and makes a very clear Poſſet-drink.</p>
            <p>If half a grain of the powder
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:116020:15"/>of Gal be put into a quart of this water doth immediately turn it into a Clarret colour; or like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſirrup of Violets mixed with water, whereto ſome drops of ſpirit of <hi>Vitriol</hi> hath been put; which if it be ſuffered to ſtand ſome hours after it is ſo turned with the Gall, a red ſand will ſettle to the bottome, and the water will become clear and bright again.</p>
            <p>I took 3. quarts of the Spaw water, &amp; evaporated it all away upon the ſire in a clean Skellet, &amp; there remained in the bottom a brown, ſaltiſh &amp; biteriſh ſand, to the quantity of three drams or near upon; but becauſe I thought the ſediment might proceed from the mixture of ſand ariſing with the water,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:116020:15"/>(although I could not diſcern any with my eye) I therefore took three quarts more, which I filtrated through a double thick wollen cloth, that I might be ſure to have no mixture of ſand, and ſet it on the fire as before to evaporate all the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which when I had done there remained the ſame quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of brackiſh ſediment as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and of the ſame colour, ſo as it plainly appeared, it was not from any mixture of ſand in the water.</p>
            <p>Then I ſet on three quarts filtrated as before in a clean Skellet, which after it had boi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a while, I diſcovered a red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh ſand at the bottome, (the very ſame that falls to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome, when it hath been colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:116020:16"/>by the gall) ſo I took it off the fire, and powred it into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother veſſell, the ſand remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning behind which I found to be about a dram, ſomewhat ſoft to the touch, not ſharp as ſand, which I take to be no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then Rubrick, or <hi>Mater ferri,</hi> or as Dr. <hi>French</hi> calls it, Vitriol of Iron, ſeparated by the heat, whoſe property it is according to Phyloſophers <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregare homogenea, &amp; ſeparare heterogenea,</hi> it having a kind of S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>iptick taſte not ſaltiſh at all. Then I ſet on the ſame water thus ſeparated from the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick, to evaporate it as before, cleanſing off the ſcumme which aroſe, and at the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="1">1. But they muſt know, that the Sun by it's heat pierces no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <pb n="34" facs="tcp:116020:26"/>
            <p n="2">2. Again the Sun and the Planets have an influence into the bowels of the earth, where neither their heat nor their light can penetrate, to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocting of minerals, that are above 100. fathome deep, as I might manifeſt at large, from the judgement of good Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, and therefore we need not doubt concerning water, which perhaps lyes nearer the ſuperfices, and requires leſs concoction.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Moreover water (I mean Spring water which is in moſt ordinary uſe) hath it's concocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and preparation according to the temperature of heat and cold that is in the earth. Now if we may believe Philoſophy, which teaches that the earth is

               <p>The Sun and the reſt of the Heavenly bodies do by their heat exhale,<note place="margin">Its cauſe</note> and draw forth out of the Sea, and other moiſt bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies that are on the Earth the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:116020:35"/>vapours, (which are the more rare and thin part of the water and bodyes) theſe by their heat they do ſo rarify, that through their levity they fly upward towards the upper region of the aire next to the Element of fire, the proper place of ſuch light bodies; where they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue till according to the <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary courſe of Providence,</hi> by the influence of the Moon, or ſome planetary Aſpect out of ſigns of the <hi>watery Triplicity,</hi> or ſome other cold and moiſt <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellation,</hi> they become more groſs and moiſt, and ſo by their weight deſcend into the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle region of the aire, where by the exceſs of cold they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſed into waters, and now being become an heavy body,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:116020:35"/>do fall down upon the Earth in ſhowers, making thereby a kind of <hi>circulation</hi> in Nature, through the aſcent of vapours and deſcent of ſhowers.</p>
               <p>This I ſay is according to the <hi>ordinary courſe of Providence,</hi> when notwithſtanding with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any of thoſe previous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of the Celeſtial bodies, <hi>Almighty God</hi> who is a moſt <hi>free Agent,</hi> and doth what he will in the Heavens and the Earth, doth ſometimes by a ſpecial Providence cauſe it to rain;<note place="margin">Exod. 9.18</note> and at other times alſo he doth ſo ſuſpend the aforeſaid influences,<note place="margin">Jam. 5.17.</note> that it rains not at all,<note place="margin">Amos 4.7.</note> as in the uſe of <hi>Elijahs</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Thus as the <hi>Prophet</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, he makes it to rain upon one City, and not upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:116020:36"/>and this he doeth that he may keep us in a conſtant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon himſelf, as upon the firſt and primary cauſe, without whoſe concurrence ſecondary cauſes can produce no effects at all.</p>
               <p>No this my judgment con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the cauſes of rain, is agreeable to what is writ upon that ſubject, by the beſt Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers and Phyſicians, the Scripture alſo being clear in it. <hi>Amos</hi> 9.6. He calleth for the Waters of the Sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the Earth: to which add that in <hi>Job</hi> 36.27, 28. He maketh ſmall the drops of water, they poure down <hi>rain</hi> according to the <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour</hi> thereof, which the <hi>clouds</hi> do drop.</p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:116020:36"/>
               <p>And that the rain doth falls or is with-held from us in <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary providence,</hi> according to the influence of the <hi>celeſtial bodyes,</hi> is deducible from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place in <hi>Job, Chap.</hi> 38. <hi>v.</hi> 25. and ſo forward; where God, expoſtulating with <hi>Iob</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his mighty works of providence, reads a Lecture to him concerning the <hi>Meteors,</hi> of Rain, Lightening, Thunder, Dew, and Froſt, with their cauſes, and in the 31. Verſe he hath this queſtion to him: Canſt thou bind (or reſtrain) the influence of the <hi>Pleiades,</hi> or looſe the bands of <hi>Orion?</hi> with other expoſtulatory queſtions: The meaning thereof is this; Canſt thou ſtay the rain, and hinder it from falling? or canſt

The <hi>Pleiades</hi> being a moiſt conſtellation in the ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the ſign <hi>Taurus,</hi> which brings wet; and <hi>Orion</hi> a dry conſtellation in the laſt decade of <hi>Gemini,</hi> ariſing in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in the beginning of the <hi>Winter,</hi> cauſing froſts. I might enlarge concerning <hi>Mazaroth, viz.</hi> the 12. ſigns, and <hi>Arcturus,</hi> which are mentioned in the 32. <hi>verſ.</hi> but I haſten. Nor is this my own private interpretation, but it's agreeable to the judgment of the moſt learned <hi>Interpreters</hi> upon the place, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of thoſe that were <hi>Members</hi> of the late reverend <hi>Aſſembly of Divines,</hi> in that their excellent expoſition upon the Book of <hi>Iob.</hi>

               <p>Now from the conſideration of what bath been, ſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the concurrent cauſe of <hi>Rain,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Its nature and quality</note> it will follow, that Rain-water is the moſt light of all others, clear and of thin parts, and agreeable with the deſcription of the beſt water before laid down, being alſo moſt <hi>ethereal,</hi> and having the feweſt terreſtrial or earthly parts of all waters whatſoever.</p>
               <p>Hence is it that <hi>Hippocrates</hi> prefers Rain-water before any other,<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>6.</hi> epid. &amp; de aq.</note> eſpecially that which falls in <hi>Summer</hi> out of white and thin clouds, and with Thunder or Winde, which do help to purify it more; but he diſcommends that which falls out of thick and black clouds, and in a ſtorm; nevertheleſs he
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:116020:38"/>would have it boyled before it be uſed, becauſe of all other waters it is moſt apt to putrefy and become corrupt.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">It ſoon corrupts.</note>Nor let any ſtartle at it, as that therefore it ſhould be the more unwholſome, becauſe it is ſubject to corrupt ſo ſoon, this being rather a token of it's goodneſs, in that it is ſo eaſily altered, according to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Paulus Aegineta, Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſius</hi> and others, although this alſo may be helped if it be kept in a cool place, and in a pure ſtone Ciſtern.</p>
               <p>Only let me give this caution that it be not long kept before it be uſed, leaſt being corrupted it cauſes hourſneſs and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of breathing, and breed Cholerick humours in the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:116020:38"/>and weaken it's reten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive faculty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Raſis</hi> ſaith, it is ill for thoſe that are ſubject to Fevers when it hath been long kept. And ſo <hi>Aetius</hi> is of the ſame mind, forbidding it alſo to be uſed in Cholerick conſtitutions, and in the jaundice, becauſe it is eaſily turned into choler, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends it to be uſed in Eye wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to ſtop a flux of humours, or to conſolidate Ulcers of the eyes, as being more aſtringent then Spring Water; which yet I cannot believe, becauſe it is as I ſaid before of thin and aerial parts, and not ſo terreſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all as Spring Water is. And for this cauſe I think it the beſt of all others to be uſed in a perient or pectoral Apozemes, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:116020:39"/>it be taken when it is new fallen, and ſtrained through a thick cloth or paper, the body alſo open.</p>
               <p>Only to that of <hi>Aetius</hi> I'le add this, that of all other wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that are drunk cold, Rain water is the worſt for <hi>cachectick</hi> conſtitutions, which have an ill habit of body, and for ſuch as are <hi>Scorbutick,</hi> for though it be of thin parts, yet becauſe it is more ſubject to putrefy then other waters, and thoſe bodies not ſo pervious as ſound bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes are, it is to be ſuſpected, leaſt it ſhould ſoon corrupt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it can paſs through the body, and ſo encreaſe the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladyes.</p>
               <p>This by it's admirable ſecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity refreſhes the Earth, and

               <p>Like unto Rain is <hi>Snow and Hail,</hi> eſpecially in their original cauſe, for they both proceed from the like vapours, which are exhaled (as I ſaid before) by the heavenly bodies, out of the Sea and the terreſtriall bodies,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:116020:40"/>&amp; elevated into the middle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the ayr, whereby a greater and more intenſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of cold then that which produceth rain, they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſed into Snow and hail; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the hail is generated by a more remiſs degree of cold then ſnow; and therefore falls ordinarily in Summer, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Snow never falls but in win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or very cold weather.</p>
               <p>I find that ſnow was much in uſe among the Ancients, who carefully preſerved it all the year, to mixt it with their wine, to allay its heat, and give it a pleaſant coolneſs to the palate.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Chares Mytilinaeus</hi> in his Hiſtory of <hi>Alexander the Great,</hi> tells how that in his
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:116020:40"/>Siege againſt <hi>Petra</hi> a City of <hi>Indiae,</hi> he was exceedingly delighted with Snow mixed in his Wine, and he relates his manner of preſerving it; <hi>viz.</hi> he cauſed many great and deep Trenches to be digged in the earth, which he covered over with Oak boughs, in which the Snow was laid, being gathered when it was new fallen, and preſerved for the uſe aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>No leſs carefull are they at this day in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> and other the hot Countreys of <hi>Europe</hi> in preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Snow to mixt it with their Wine, to give it a pleaſant coolneſs, laying it up in their loweſt and cooleſt Cellars, and covering it as before ſaid, and ſo they keep it till winter come again.</p>

I conceive no more is meant in that Scripture, but that <hi>Almighty God</hi> hath ſet certain limits &amp; bounds which the waters ſhould not paſs theſe bounds and limits I take not to be ſupernatural, as if the water reſtrain'd by a miraculous word of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand, ſhould be forced to contain it ſelf within its circuit preſcribed to it; but natural as cliffs &amp; hils, within w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſeems to be intrenched; for we may ſee there is no ſuch force put upon it; but if the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural bounds of the <hi>Sea,</hi> to wit, the cliffs be removed, the <hi>Sea</hi>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:116020:53"/>overruns the Land, and turns all into it ſelf.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Authors</hi> of this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion urge further, <label type="milestone">

               <p>I Anſwer, if we conſider theſe Elements among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> we muſt give the height to the water, for as much as the greateſt part by far of the Earth lyes drowned, for that which is above, bears no ſenſible propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with that which lyes under the water.

                  </label> ſeem to ſee the Land far lower then the water.</p>
               <p>This may eaſily be made out of Opticall principles,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> that it muſt appear ſo, by reaſon that the <hi>Sphericall</hi> ſigure and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xity of the Sea, interpoſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt our ſight and the lower part of the Land, doth hide ſome parts from our ſight, whence it muſt needs appear lower, being couched almoſt under water; The like is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable in another Ship at <hi>Sea,</hi> which ſeems to be depreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed underwater at ſom Leagues diſtance, ſo as nothing appears
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:116020:54"/>but her top Sails. Beſides at diſtance all things ſeem lower even upon a levell at Land, which when we draw nigh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, do better diſcover their height.</p>
               <p>I read that in <hi>Noahs</hi> Flood, <hi>God</hi> brake open the springs of the deep, and opened the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taracts of heaven, to pour down rain continually many days to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether upon the Earth, of which there had been no neceſſity at all, had the <hi>Sea</hi> been heaped up in ſuch ſort as they imagine; for the only withdrawing of his hand, and letting looſe the reins that the water might have run to an evenneſs, would have been ſufficient to have overwhelmed the whole earth.</p>
               <p>Again, we find by experience,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:116020:55"/>and our <hi>Mariners</hi> do all agree in it, that a like gale of Wind will ſerve to carry a Ship out of the Port to the open <hi>Sea,</hi> as from the <hi>Sea</hi> into the Port, which could not be, if the <hi>Sea</hi> were higher then the Land, for they would need a great and ſtiffe gale to carry them up the bank of the <hi>Sea,</hi> and none at all to run into the Land.</p>
               <p>And thus I conceive wee are free'd from that abſurd conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, which their Doctrine of the <hi>Seas Elevation</hi> at diſtance, and depreſſion on the ſhore, doth neceſſarily infer; to wit, that the water which runs out of Rivers in the ebbe, as ſoon as it reaches to the <hi>Sea,</hi> muſt run up the hill in its own naturall motion, which is againſt the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:116020:55"/>of heavy bodies, whoſe motion is ever downward to the Center of the Earth, as alſo <hi>Ariſtotle's</hi> own Doctrine elſe where.<note place="margin">Lib. c. de coelo. c. <hi>4.</hi>

               <p>Beſides, as Dr. <hi>French</hi> well obſerves, a man would think ſo many great Rivers terminated in the <hi>Sea,</hi> might be a ſufficient moyſture for the taking away of the termination made by the dryneſs of the Earth, and to make the Globus <hi>Sea</hi> ſink to an evenneſs.</p>
               <p>Moreover tht manner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance of the <hi>Sea</hi> water to the heads of <hi>Springs</hi> fancied by Dr. <hi>Jordan,</hi> through the ſecret channells of the Earth, requires a man of much credulity to believe him; to wit, that the water in thoſe his ſubterraneall
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:116020:56"/>crannyes ſhould without any force upon it, leave its naturall figure, and correſpond with its levell, and yet the ſame water being expoſed to the open air near the ſhore, ſhould both make and abide in a valley.

               <p>That there are bituminous fires our own reaſon (beſides the teſtimony of good <hi>Authors</hi>) doth ſufficiently evince,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> they being the efficient cauſe of hot <hi>Springs,</hi> ſuch as are thoſe men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Pliny</hi> the one in <hi>Sicily,</hi> the other at <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſata;</hi>

               </p>
               <p>But firſt Dr. <hi>French</hi> ſuppoſes great Caverns of waters to be in the earth which come from the Sea,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>pag.</hi> 16, 17. <hi>pag.</hi> 23.</note> the heat alſo to be of like proportion with the water; what a conflict this would make in nature wee may eaſily judge, when theſe two e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies fire and water muſt be ſo immured together. I wonder the water being of like propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which the fire doth not quench it, or that the fire con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes not the water, and ſo in both caſes we ſhould want wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi>

                  </note> this ſuppoſes the earth to be almoſt nothing but Caverns: for if that be true that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith concerning <hi>Springs,</hi> that if all water that runs out of them in one year could bee kept in a veſſell, it would almoſt equalize the whole bulk of the earth; and Dr. <hi>French</hi> tells us, there is a like proportion of fire and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the Caverns; and reaſon tells us, that fire cannot be kept in without a greater quantity of air, which it continually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:116020:62"/>then what may wee judge concerning the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> this implyes the Earth to be almoſt nothing but <hi>bitumen</hi> or <hi>Naphtha,</hi> nor will his new generations be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to maintain the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> this ſuppoſes all the Earth to be on fire, ſince al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in all places there are Springs, and conſequently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts the whole ſuffrage of Philoſophers, who call the Earth <hi>Elementum Frigidisſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> the Earth would in time be conſumed by ſo many fires, as ſaith <hi>Agricola,</hi> it being of a calcinable and combuſtible matter.</p>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:116020:62"/>
               <p>Sixtly, If it were ſo, then the water would have a bitumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous taſte or ſmell, which we know it hath not ordinarily, it not differing in quality from thoſe waters which are wont to break in the manner of <hi>Springs</hi> after great rains, of which ſort we have many break out year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the <hi>Wolds in York-ſhire,</hi> commonly called by the name of <hi>Gypſies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, its not probable that there are ſo many fires in the earth, becauſe thoſe that dig in <hi>Mines</hi> in ſeveral Countries, do meet uſually with water which moleſt them, but no fires.</p>
               <p>But to proceed, if the <hi>perco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Sea</hi> were the cauſe of <hi>Springs,</hi> then we ſhould uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally have the moſt plentifull
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:116020:63"/>
                  <hi>Springs</hi> near the <hi>Sea,</hi> by reaſon of the nearneſs to their Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; when as to the contrary we find, that thoſe Towns w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> are ſcituate neer the Sea, are more deſtitute of water, then others that are more remote. Again thoſe <hi>Springs</hi> that are upon the <hi>Sea</hi> ſhore ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably ſympathize in their growth, or decreaſe with the <hi>Sea,</hi> and ſo at the Spring-Tides ſhould flow more plentifully, and at Neap-Tides more ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly, as thoſe <hi>Springs</hi> I juſt now ſpake of, the <hi>Gypſies,</hi> are more or leſs according to the rain, whereas no ſuch thing is obſervable in the other. Nor is this <hi>Spring</hi> of which we treat, to wit, the <hi>Spaw,</hi> which is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the level of the Spring-tides,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:116020:63"/>and ſometimes overflow by them, in the leaſt wiſe altered by them,<note place="margin">The Spaw not altered by the Tides.</note> as ever I could obſerve to flow more freely at the Spring-Tides, and ſlower at the Neap-Tides, when the <hi>Sea</hi> is at ſomewhat a further diſtance; nor yet is its taſte altered in the leaſt, or its efficacy in working, (notwithſtanding w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> I think it hath ſome Salt in it from the <hi>Sea,</hi> and is thereby exalted in ſome qualities.) Whereas it is very obſervable, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it breaks out of the ground, within three or four yards of the foot of the cliffe, which is near 40 yards high, &amp; within a quarter of a mile there is another hill, that is more then as high again above the Cliffe, and a deſcent all the way to the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:116020:64"/>Cliffe, ſo as the rain water can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not lie long upon the ground: I ſay nevertheleſs it is obſervable that after a great rain the water is altered in its taſte,<note place="margin">But is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by rain.</note> &amp; leſſenened in its operation. Indeed a rainy day or two will not hurt it all.</p>
               <p>But to return to the ground of the opinion, which is built upon the Seas ſole ſufficiency, to afford ſo great and conſtant a ſupply of waters to feed the <hi>Springs:</hi> I eaſily grant it to be the beſt Store-houſe, and do only diſſent about the manner of conveyance, of which I ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak by and by.</p>
               <p>And for the other ground, becauſe the <hi>Sea</hi> is not increaſed by the multitude of waters that flow into it daily, which it muſt
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:116020:64"/>of neceſſity be, if they had not by their ſubterraneal Channels a recourſe to their Foun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Valeſius</hi> indeed interprets it to be the ſame with <hi>Moſes</hi> his Abyſſe, or elſe ſome hidden part of the <hi>Sea.</hi> But this I paſs over as one of the Philoſophers dreams, being alſo confuted by his Scholar <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle,</hi> who gives a full anſwer,<note place="margin">lib. <hi>2.</hi> Met. c. <hi>4.</hi>

               <p>That the Elements may be tranſmuted one into another, eſpecially thoſe that are placed neereſt one another, agreeing together more in quality then the reſt, is the doctrine of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle,</hi>

                  </note> and agreeable with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and very obvious to the ſenſes. I can eaſily believe, that the thinner parts of earth may be turned into water, as alſo the groſſer parts of water into earth; ſo the thinner and more ſubtile parts of water in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:116020:66"/>air, and the groſſer parts of air into water, and therefore it may be true that <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaith, although it is rejected by Mr. <hi>Lydiat,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">de Origin, font.</note> but that the earth which is a dry body, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted by Philoſophers <hi>Elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum Siccisſimum,</hi> ſhould by tranſmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation afford ſo much water, or the hundred part of what flowes out of Springs, is a thing ſo voyd of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as it needs no arguments to diſprove it, and is not likely to gain many followers.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> this implyes ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe of air, as the whole Element of <hi>air</hi> would not ſuffice to feed that gulfe. <hi>Bodinus</hi> ſaith it would not be ſufficient for one day, and therefore he laughs at the Philoſopher.<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>2.</hi> The. at. nat.</note> But certainly it had been long ſince ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct out of the meſs of Elements, if <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> had been in the right in this contrverſie.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Subterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neall lakes contribute nothing.</note>But as for ſubterraneal lakes that are found in the bottome of great Caverns of the Earth, they are ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding waters, oftentimes of poyſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous quality, as I hinted in the 6th Section, which having room enough and ſupplyed with air above them, I think they incline not to motion, and do contribute nothing to Springs, nor can any ſubterraneal heat which Dr. <hi>French</hi> ſuppoſes to be in theſe Caverns, extract a wholeſome water out of them.</p>
               <p>And this <hi>Rain or Snow</hi> water in the Channells, where-ever it finds vent, it continues to flow, ſo long
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:116020:70"/>as the Channells by which ſuch a Spring is fed, have any water to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it, and that is more or leſs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the wideneſs or length of the Channells, or otherwiſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the number that meet together, it not reſting till it meets with the air; And therefore it is obſervable in pipes that convey wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from one veſſell to another, the water will flow till all its ſtore bee ſpent, whether the motion bee up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or tranſverſe, till it meet with air, and then it ceaſes to flow, for if one bore a hole in the pipe, and let in air, the motion is done.</p>
               <p>Theſe Channells alſo are furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed according to the quantity of <hi>Rain</hi> that falls, and the advantages they have of receiving it, by the ſmall and ſecret paſſages that come from the ſuperficies of the earth, which concenter in thoſe Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nells.</p>

               <p>Now this opinion of <hi>Rain</hi> and <hi>Snow</hi> water to bee the Originall of Springs,<note place="margin">Argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts to prove.</note> is illuſtrated with many arguments of demonſtration by the Authors before mentioned, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of this judgement, the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall whereof are theſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Becauſe it is found by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that fountains and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently rivers, are greater and do abound more with water in Winter, and moyſt weather then in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> in thoſe years when great Rain do falls in Summer, and great ſtore of Snow in Winter, wee find Springs durable, whereas in droughty ſeaſons when there is but little or no Rain or snow, the Springs dry up. A ſure proof where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we had in <hi>England</hi> in the years 1654, 55, and 56. when our climate was dryer then ever any ſtoryes mention, ſo as we had very little
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:116020:71"/>Rain in Summer, or Snow in Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, moſt of our Springs were dryed up, even ſuch as in the memory of the Eldeſt men living had never wan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted water, but were of thoſe ſorts Springs which we call <hi>fontes peren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> or at leaſt were eſteemed ſo; which if they had received their ſupply of water from the Sea, or from the air in the earth converted into water, they could not have fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of water.</p>
               <p>A third reaſon which perſwades to this Originall is, becauſe in thoſe Climates and Countries where little Rain falls, few or no Springs and Rivers are ſeen. As in the deſerts <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> and in moſt parts of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica</hi> neer the equinoctial they have little water, and many times in two or three days journey can hardly find enough to quench their thirſt and their Camells, as Hiſtorians re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late. and ſo in <hi>Egypt</hi> where it rains
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:116020:71"/>very ſeldom, but they are ſupplyed inſtead of it by the overflowing of <hi>Nilus,</hi> there are no Springs at all. Whereas in <hi>Britain, Germany,</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> and other Northern parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> there are great plenty of Springs and Rivers, in regard they do abound in the moyſture of the air, and great falls of Rain and Snow.</p>

                  </note> that the abounding of Rivers with water in Winter, is from the ſtore of Rain or Snow water, that runs into them from the higher grounds, and not from any great quantity of water that falls into them out of Springs and Fountains.</p>
               <p>I deny not but the Rivers are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly heightned in Winter from Rain,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> ſo as on the ſudden they will often overflow their banks, but that water is ſoon ſpent in the Sea; It is ſufficient for defence of the point in
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:116020:72"/>hand, if after that water in reaſon ſhould be ſpent, they be yet main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained more plentifully by the Springs, then uſually they are in Summer; at which ſeaſon of the year, though they be filled with a ſudden flood of Rain, yet wanting the conſtant benevolence of the Springs, they ſuddenly fall as low as they were before.</p>

                  </note> as alſo by M. <hi>Carpenter</hi> in the place before cited; to wit, that the greateſt Rain that can fall never ſinks above ten foot into the ground; and <hi>Seneca</hi> cites his own obſervation for it in the digging of Vineyards, and he gives this reaſon for it, becauſe when the earth is once ſatisfied with ſhowers, it op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes it ſelf againſt the overplus by ſhutting its pores.</p>
               <p>I own it thus far,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> that into the ſolid earth the Rain ſinks not above ten
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:116020:72"/>foot, although learned <hi>Cardane</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows it ten paces or fathomes, his words being <hi>non ultra decem paſſus deſcendere.</hi>

                  </note> But what becomes of that immenſe quantity of rain, which often continues for many weeks together, nay oft times ſome months, wherein we have ſcarce a fair and dry day, beſides the infinite quantity of wet and Snow that is falling all Winter long, cauſing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undations of water over all the Country round about, not only up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on higher grounds neer unto rivers, into which it may run <hi>per declive,</hi> but in plains from whence it can have no current at all, can it be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that ten foot of earth will drink up all this water, which who ſo ſhall dig ſoon after the water is drunk up, ſhall not find it very moiſt or muddy, which it would aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly be if it had not ſome ſecret paſſage into the Caverns of the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:116020:73"/>earth, much deeper then they ſpeak of? And therefore <hi>Cardane</hi> in the place before cited, adds, that the earth is ſadned with the Rain, ſo as it lyes above, unleſs by ſome empty crevice, or cleft, it ſink deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er into the earth, which is all I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for, and which being granted will be ſufficient to quicken and continue the Springs.</p>

                  </note> on which he layes much ſtreſs; That the great mountains of Rock and Stone which have little or no earth on them, and on that account not capable of receiving much rain,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:116020:73"/>do nevertheleſs yield great and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting Springs, which are never drawn dry.</p>
               <p>This makes nothing againſt, but rather for the point in controverfie.<note place="margin">Solut.</note> There are no Rocks but they have their Commiſſure, joints or clefts: now the Rain and Snow water can run more plentifully into thoſe joints and clefts of the Rocks, and and more ſpeedily, then when it falls upon the ſolid earth; And in that he faith they are not cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with much earth, they are the leſs robbed of what falls from the clouds, and ſo are better ſupplyed. To this I'le further add, that Rocks have more large and ſpacious Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns, that are fit receptacles for the water, the ſolid earth hath. Adde to this that Rocks are uſually ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny together, covering much ground, ordinarily a whole Country is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Rocks, and ſo can receive
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:116020:74"/>much wet, and their ſtore by their nakedneſs of earth hath a freſh ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply from every ſhower that falls. And therefore on all theſe accounts, as they have advantages of ſpeedy reception of what falls without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution, and ca pacities for admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of greater quantities of wet then other ſoyles have, ſo they may very well afford more plentiful and durable fountains.</p>
               <p>Beſides it is obſervable, that in the ſolid clay ſoyles it is very rare to find any eruption of water, becauſe ſuch are ſad earth, and have few or no Caverns or Channells in them, but our Springs break out ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Rocky, gravelly ground, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the beſt water, and moſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting Springs, ſuch as we call <hi>fontes perennes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another <hi>Objection</hi> that <hi>Seneca</hi> makes againſt it is this, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. Ibid. </seg>
                  </label> that in the dryeſt ſoyle, where they dig pits two
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:116020:74"/>or three hundred foot deep, there is often found great plenty of water, which no man can ſuppoſe to have come from the clouds, but he thinks it of that ſort which is wont to bee called <hi>living water.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From whence then ſhould it come,<note place="margin">Solut.</note> from the Sea? perhaps the Sea is as many miles from that water as the ſuperficies of the earth is feet from it, and may much more bee queſtioned. But we may remember <hi>Seneca</hi>'s judgement concerning the originall of Springs is, that they are generated by tranſumtation of earth into water;<note place="margin">de Origin. font.</note> an aſſertion ſo ridiculous, as he is laughed at by M. <hi>Lydiat,</hi> and never had any as yet to take his part. Perhaps it may come from the tranſmutation of air into water, for ſuch tranſmuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I cannot deny, wee ſee Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches become wet before rain falls from this cauſe: But its moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:116020:75"/>to come from Rain, which may poſſibly peirce by its crannyes much deeper then he ſpeaks of, as I have ſhewen already. Our Miners will tell him that in Winter after great inundations of Rain, they are much troubled with water in the bottome of their Mines, finding it frequently diſtilling through the ſolid earth upon their heads by the ſecret capillar veins, (as I may call them) that come from the ſuperſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the earth, whereas in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer or dry ſeaſons they find no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption at all. Touching the terme <hi>living water</hi> which is uſed by <hi>Seneca,</hi> I think no more is meant by it, then ſuch as flowes from ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>running fountains, which therefore in Engliſh we commonly call <hi>quick Springs.</hi>

But whether theſe effects proceed from
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:116020:77"/>a ſuperſtitious conceit of this Saint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Well, which raiſes the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of ſome, or ſome Minerall quality, or rather (which I moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to) from the exceſſive c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Perhaps the Earth may drink up a great part of the water of Rivers as they paſs along,<note place="margin">Solut.</note> and thence it comes to paſs, that near Rivers the earth is more fertile, and in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer thoſe meadows not ſo much parched with heat as elſewhere, and thence it is that they flow low, having probably but a few Springs to ſupply them, in compariſon
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:116020:79"/>of what they had, many being dryed up by reaſon of the heat of the weather and want of Rain. And that the ſuperficies of the earth near Springs may drink up ſome of their moyſture, we may well ſuppoſe, but that cannot be much, nor the attraction of ſuch force as to draw from far, ſo as to weaken the current of a Spring conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, much leſs to dry it up, for as much as the water of the Spring is not diffuſed abroad as the water of Rivers is, but pent up in a narrow Channell through which it paſſes.</p>
               <p>Again, ſince it is true as natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts tell us, that the heart of the Sun peirces not above ten foot into the earth to dry it, the water that ſuch a little quantity of earth may need, or can draw, will not be in any proportion towards the drying up a Spring, eſpecially ſeeing it lyes in a narrow channel, and alſo
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:116020:79"/>perhaps riſes upright out of the earth like a boyling pot.</p>
               <p>And whereas he objects again, that the moſt part of the Rain that falls on high places runs into plains, and from thence into Rivers, and where it cannot ſo run, it remains upon the ſuperficies till it be exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the Sun.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, we ſee a great quantity of water runs into Rivers after great Rains, when they are nigh at hand; but what becomes of all that which falls in a whole Country far from Rivers, and of the infinite quantity of Snow which covered the ſurface of the ground, and ſets all the Country in a flood when it melts, ſo as a man would think it could not be dryed up in many months, and this where there is no current at all into Rivers? The moderate heat of the Sun in rainy weather, eſpecially
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:116020:80"/>in the Winter months, is ſuch as it cannot be thought to exhale the tenth part of it into vapours, and yet in a few days its all gone, and no footſteps of it left ſave in the roads, whereby the continual beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the horſes, it is ſo ſadned that it cannot ſink of a long time.</p>
               <p>As for that place of <hi>Seneca</hi> which he urges, I have anſwered it alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in this Section; And for the digging of the Well, where ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times no water can be got two or three hundred foot deep, before we come at Springs: That may be, and yet make nothing againſt the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſinking much deeper, ſince though there be many Channells of water in the earth, yet it is poſſible to miſs them in ſuch a narrow com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs as a Well, and yet there may be ſtore of water near hand.</p>
               <p>Nor can the duſt or dirt, which
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:116020:80"/>he ſaith, may be conveyed by the water into the veins or crannyes, by which it ſhould paſs down into the earth, hinder it any more, then the excrementitious humors that are in the bowels, do hinder the chyle from paſſing into the <hi>Lactaea,</hi> or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentery veins, and ſo to the Liver; both which may be thereby hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in part; ſo as they cannot paſs ſo ſpeedily, yet it is not ſo in all bodies, nor all over the ground, only in ſome places it lyes above the earth a while, before it can finde paſſage down.</p>
               <p>Another Objection which ſome make againſt this opinion of the Original of Springs by Rain and Snow is this, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                  </label> that although all this ſhould be granted, yet they think there doth not ſo much Rain and Snow fall, as may ſuffice to ſupply them with ſuch abundance of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as they vent.</p>
               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:116020:81"/>
               <p>I would have ſuch to conſider what hath been already ſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the immenſe quantity of wet that falls in Winter, beſides the great Spouts of Rain, that ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly every year at ſome time or other are falling in Summer, which often ſets the whole Country in a Flood, together with other frequent ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and whether there is not a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable proportion of wet for ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of the Springs, eſpecially while we conſider the paucity of great Springs, and the diſtance that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt one Spring &amp; another, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times two or three miles of ground affording but a few Springs, and thoſe perhaps of very ſmal currents, moſt Towns being ſupplied with Well water, of which very little is loſt.</p>
               <p>Again, it is very obſervable, that a great quantity of that water which runs out of Springs that are placed
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:116020:81"/>on high ground neer hill<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Nor need this aſſertion ſeem ſtrange to any, ſeeing we read of great Rivers that hide their channels in the earth for many miles together ſometimes, and break out again, as the <hi>Rhine</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> cited by <hi>Seneca;</hi>

               <p>Having thus weighed and anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the moſt material exceptions, that are made againſt this Original by learned men, I cannot but joyn in judgement with <hi>Albertus</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gricola,</hi> yet not altogether excluding the other two, eſpecially that of the <hi>percolation of the Sea</hi> to Springs neer adjoyning; but how ſuch as break out on high Lands, and at great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the Sea, can be thought to be ſupplied from thence, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe then by the ſhowers that fall from heaven, I confeſs I ſee not,

               <p>Nevertheleſs we muſt not forget from whence Rain &amp; Snow do natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally proceed, &amp; that the Sea is the principal ſtorehouſe for the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of vapours, out of which they are made by condenſation, the Earth and the moyſt bodies thereon not affording any proportionable quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity to the wet that falls from the clouds.</p>
               <p>I ſhall now haſten to a period of this diſpute, being only willing to illuſtrate what hath been ſaid, by a
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:116020:83"/>quotation out of learned and labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious Dr. <hi>Heylin,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Coſmog. p. 677.</note> in his <hi>Coſmogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy</hi> the ſecond Edition <hi>p.</hi> 667. where treating of <hi>Cyprus</hi> an Iſland in the Mediterranean Sea, in length two hundred miles, and ſixty miles broad, he tells that in the days of <hi>Conſtantine the great,</hi> there was an exceeding long drought, ſo as for thirty ſix years they had no rain, in ſo much as all the Springs and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents or Rivers were dryed up, ſo as the inhabitants were forced to forſake the Iſland, and ſeek for new habitations for want of freſh water. Now if the Sea had been the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of the Springs, they could not have wanted water, it being an Iſland and not very great; or if the tranſmutation of air into water in the Caverns of the Earth, there could have been no defect; ſince the Caverns were the ſame; ſo that its evident the Springs proceeded from
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:116020:83"/>the Rain, which failing they were dryed up.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe whoſoever ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the water which flowes out of Springs, with that which immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately falls from the clouds, ſhall find ſuch a full and perfect agreement betwixt them in all qualities per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible to the ſenſes, as its hard to diſtinguiſh the one from the other.

               <p>Laſtly the two rarities I mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the beginning, that are to be found upon the Caſtle hill in <hi>Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brough;</hi> to wit, the deep Well that reaches to the bottom of the Rock,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:116020:84"/>which hath no water, &amp; the Spring Well which is within half a yard of the edg of the Rock towards the Sea, which never wants water, do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what illuſtrate the point in hand. For the deep Well being ſo neer the Sea, ſhould probably have water in it, if there were any ſuch percolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as is ſpoken of; or if air were ſo plentifully tranſmuted in water, it ſhould not be dry; which yet it is, there being no Channells that emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty themſelves into it; while the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is upon the top of the Rock, not many yards deep, and alſo upon the very edge of the cliffe is ſupplyed, which doubtleſs is done by ſecret Channells within the ground that convey the Rain and ſhowers into it, being placed on a dependant part of the Rock; near unto which there are alſo Cellars under an old ruinated Chappell, which after a great rain are full of
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:116020:84"/>water, but are dryed up in a long drought.</p>
               <p>I now proceed to confider of the nature of Spring water,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The nature of Spring</hi> water De ſimpl. med. fac. c. <hi>4.</hi>

Nevertheleſs ſome Springs are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then others. <hi>Hyppocrates</hi> prefers ſuch as flow out of Rocksand Hils of gravell or ſtone, as more clear and white then what coms out of other ſoyls; as alſo ſuch Springs as are cold in summer and warm in Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which is aſſuredly ſound in them if their fountains be deep in the Rock, and this is a ſure token whereby wee may diſtinguiſh of Well water alſo. And to this of <hi>Hyppocrates</hi> I might join the whole ſuffrage of all Philoſophers and Phyſicians that may have writ upon this Subject. To ſum up all in a
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:116020:85"/>word, beſides what was ſaid in the ſecond Section: The principall to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of good and wholeſome water is, that it be ſimple or unmixed, and then it loads not the ſtomach, and eaſily paſſes through the <hi>Hypechon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dres,</hi> being alſo ſoon hot and ſoon cold.</p>
               <p>I find ſome of the Ancients were wont to weigh their water, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted that the beſt which was the lighteſt, and for this cauſe it ſeems it was, that the <hi>Perſian Kings</hi> would drink of no water but of the River <hi>Eulaeus</hi> an Attick ſaucer whereof weighed leſſe by a Dram then other waters, as <hi>Strabo</hi> ſaith.

               <p>Now among the ſeverall ſorts of fountains <hi>Hyppocrates</hi> commends moſt thoſe that open towards the Eaſt,<note place="margin">

But we need not fear that in this

               <p>But I muſt not wade too far into this ſtream, leaſt I loſe my ſelf and my Subject, eſpecially ſince River
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:116020:90"/>water contributes nothing to the <hi>Spaw at Scarborough,</hi> there being none acer it. Nor have we the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Nilus</hi> here; our Rivers in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> are compounded of ſeveral ſorts of waters, and therefore not ſo wholſom; and yet it is the beſt or only water that ſome Towne have for their ordinary uſe; the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Owſe</hi> being alſo moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly uſed by this City of <hi>York,</hi> for whoſe cauſe eſpecially I will ſay ſomething more concerning it.</p>
               <p>River water is not ſo good as Rain or Spring Water, the Sun ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving exhaled the thin parts it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more groſs, yet it will keep longer then either of the other, and will make ſtronger Bear then either of them, it being more eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impregnated with the ſtrength of the Malt by reaſon of its groſs parts; but it is not ſo good for Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines as the other. Now the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:116020:90"/>why it will keep longer then Rain or Spring water is, becauſe it hath paſſed already ſome degrees of fermentation by the heat of the Sun, yet the water of ſome Rivers will keep longer then other. <hi>Bacci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> ſaith the water of <hi>Tiber</hi> wil keep an hundred years and not corrupt,<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>1.</hi> de ag teber. c. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> the reaſon is becauſe it is groſſe and thick like Oyle, on which account its unwholeſome to be drunk.</p>
               <p>River water is not to be uſed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter rain till it hath purged it ſelfe, and doth become clear, and its the beſt when it is taken out of the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the River, which if that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee done, then let it be taken out of ſome deep place, and not where it is ſhallow, alſo above the Cities and Towns, before the filth of the channels run into it. Great care likewiſe ſhould be taken by the <hi>Governours of Cities</hi> that no Carrion be caſt into Rivers, both becauſe it
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:116020:91"/>corrupts the water, and deſtroyes the fiſhes; likewiſe that no cloaths be waſhed, or boyes bathe, or horſes be watered above thoſe places where the water is taken up, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in times of common contagion and peſtilential diſeaſes. In which particulars the <hi>Antient Law-makers</hi> were exceeding carefull, appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing certain Officers for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of their waters, whom they called <hi>Hydrophylaces,</hi> which were perſons of the beſt quality, and had great immunities conferred on them, and were to ſee to the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Laws in execution con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning waters,<note place="margin">Cat. glor. muud. par. <hi>12.</hi> p. <hi>259.</hi>
                  </note> as <hi>Caſſanaeus</hi> relates out of <hi>Franciſcus de Ripa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This water being taken up ſhould be kept in large Stone Ceſterns, (not leaden which are apt to breed dyſenterie fluxes) and thoſe very clean, into which if ſome gravell ſtones gathered out of a freſh River
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:116020:91"/>were put, it would preſerve it lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and cooler.<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>2.</hi> loc. com. c. <hi>7.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Valleriola</hi> would have alſo ſome little fiſhes put in to keep in motion; and when it is firſt put in the Ceſterns, it ſhould be poured through a thick woollen cloth, that no ſandy or ſlimy ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance may paſs through, River wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being very ſubject to have ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment more then other ſorts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paulus Zachias</hi> a famous Roman Phyſician tells of a pretty device which was uſed by Cardinall <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſco Maria de Monte,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">L. <hi>5.</hi> quaeſt. med. leg. tit, <hi>4.</hi> q. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> one much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in Chymicall experiments, whereby he puryfied the water of <hi>Tyber,</hi> and made it wholeſome to be drunk. He had two large Ceſterns of an <hi>Hollands</hi> ſort of Stone, that was of a porous ſubſtance, which would hold fifteen gallons a piece, theſe were ſo placed that the water that was put into the one, might in ſome convenient ſpace of time diſtil
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:116020:92"/>through the ſtone into the other, under which he had a third, which received what dropped through the ſecond. Neither of the uppermoſt was perforated at all, but the water paſſed through the pores of them, in the bottoms of both which there was ever found ſuch ſediment; This water ſo tranſcolated was ſo pure and thin, that it would eaſily paſſe through the Hypochondres, and the Cardinall told my Author, that he found much benefit in it againſt the ſtone, and that it provoked u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine quickly.</p>
               <p>I conceive this to be very ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and a neat way eaſie to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimented, and very proper for ſuch as have weak bodies, and yet are forced to make uſe of ſome of the groſſer ſorts of water, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they may ſo purifie them, as they may become much more wholſome

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:116020:93"/>hinted in the firſt Section; to wit, Vitriol, Iron, Allome, Nitre, and Salt; Concerning the nature of which Mineralls I ſhall ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and then proceed to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and vertures of the <hi>Spaw</hi> it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>

                  </note> a learned <hi>Germane,</hi> and very judicious in the nature of Mineralls and Metalls, reckons up ſix ſorts of ſimple Minerall waters; to wit, Salt, Nitrous, Aluminous, Atramentarious, Sulphureous, and Bituminous; this which we treat of is mixed or compound, partaking of ſeverall of theſe together.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Water may imbibe the nature of Mineralls.</note>Now there are ſeverall wayes whereby water may imbibe the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and vertue of a Minerall or Metall.</p>
               <p>Firſt, by receiving its <hi>vapour,</hi> and thus let water ſtand ſome while in a braſſe skellet, (or ſome other Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall as Iron) and it will taſte of braſs
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:116020:93"/>or Iron, and the ſooner if it bee warm, when yet the skellet hath loſt nothing of its ſubſtance, and that water would all evaporate into Air.</p>
               <p>Secondly, when ſome of their <hi>juyce</hi> is diſſolved in the water, and that is while the Mineralls are but yet young &amp; in <hi>fieri,</hi> or as Chymiſts ſpeak <hi>in ſolutis principiis,</hi> for at that time their concrete juyces are diſſoluble in water,<note place="margin">In ſyntag. p. <hi>221.</hi>
                  </note> as <hi>Libavius</hi> ſaith.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, another way is by <hi>Corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the ſubſtance</hi> of the Mineralls mentioned by <hi>Galen,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lib. <hi>1</hi> de ſimpl. med. fac.</note> and this is performed by the help of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete <hi>juyces</hi> we now mentioned diſſolved in the water, which cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rode and extract Mineral ſubſtances. And this commonly is done by ſuch waters as have imbibed Vitri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oll at the firſt, for they do thereby become hungry and corroſive, and
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:116020:94"/>ſo the fitter to take in to them any other Minerall that lyes in their way: an example whereof we ſee in <hi>aqua fortis,</hi> which will corrode the ſubſtance of another Metall, and convert it into its own nature, the difference only lyes in a <hi>magis</hi> and <hi>minus.</hi> The like we ſee in vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble acide juyces, as vinegar, as juice of Lemmons, which will cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rode Iron, and cauſe a ruſtinſes to grow upon it, which will ſoon waſt its ſubſtance, at leaſt make it more eaſie to diſſolve.</p>
               <p>Fourthly and laſtly, by <hi>confuſion,</hi> changing the ſubſtance of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall into water; and this is when the Minerall is of ſuch a nature, and that it is capable of being converted into water, as Salt and Nitre will both ſo perfectly turn into water (and Allom alſo although its not ſo fuſible as the other) a little being put to them, as if they were nothing
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:116020:94"/>elſe. And this they wil do the more quickly, if the water hath imbibed a vitrioline juyce, but then take the water and evaporate it away, and the Mineralls will be found remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the bottome. An example whereof we have in this our <hi>Spaw water,</hi> three quarts whereof being evaporated over the fire, there will be found in the bottome three Drams of a brown brackiſh ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which being ſeparated as was ſaid in the firſt Section, two Drams will be found to be Allome, Nitre and Salt, the reſt the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of an Iron Minerall.</p>
               <p>But becauſe I ſpake now of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall <hi>juyces,</hi> while the Mineralls are but young and <hi>in fieri,</hi> its requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite I ſay ſomething concerning their production.</p>
               <p>Some have imagined that Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls and Metalls were created per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect at the firſt,<note place="margin">Fallop. de met. c. <hi>11.</hi>
                  </note> ſeeing there appears

                  </note> and becauſe their ſubſtances are not ſo fluxible but firm and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent. But as they are ſubject to corruption in time, by reaſon of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny impurities and differing parts in them, beſides other accidentall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cays, ſo they have need to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired and preſerved by generation, as learned Dr. <hi>Jordan</hi> obſerves.<note place="margin">Nat. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

               </p>
               <p>It appears in <hi>Geneſis</hi> that plants were not created perfect at firſt, but onely in their ſeminaries: for in the 2. of <hi>Gen.</hi> 5. <hi>Moſes</hi> gives a reaſon why plants were not come forth of the earth; to wit, becauſe (as <hi>Tremelius</hi> tranſlates it) there had as yet neither any rain fallen, nor any dew aſcended from the earth, whereby they might be produced: The like we may judge of Minerals, that they were not at firſt created perfect, but in their Seminaries alſo
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:116020:95"/>for the ſame reaſon, moyſture being as neceſſary for the production of Mineralls within the earth, as of vegetables above, as I ſaid in the ſecond Section,<note place="margin">Deort. ſubt. <hi>5.</hi> c. <hi>1.</hi> l. ib.</note> and to this do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>Agricola</hi> and Dr. <hi>Jordan.</hi>

               <p>And therefofe it hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways a received maxime among Philoſophers, that Mineralls are generated, and our own daily expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience confirms it. Our Salt Peter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, when they have extracted Salt Peter out of a floor of earth one year, within three or four years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, do find more generated there, and do work it over again. The like is obſerved of Allome &amp; Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peras; And ſo of Iron, <hi>Gaudentius Merula</hi> reports of <hi>Ilva</hi> an Iſland in the <hi>Adriatick Sea,</hi> where Iron breeds as faſt as they work it, which is confirmed by <hi>Agricola</hi> and <hi>Baccius,</hi> and by <hi>Virgil</hi> who ſaith of it.</p>

Only the difference is, the plants are increaſed by an extenſion of the parts generated in all propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, by the ingreſs of nouriſhment and the Mineralls are augmented externally upon the ſuperficies, as naturaliſts ſay <hi>juxta poſitionem,</hi> by ſuperaddition of new matter, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted by the ſame vertue and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits into the ſame <hi>ſpecies.</hi>

And that it wants not the ſubſtance of Iron is apparent, in that after it hath been boyled a while, there appears a red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh ſand, which is nothing elſe but <hi>mater ferri,</hi> or rubrick, or as Dr. <hi>French</hi> calls it, a Vitriol of Iron: which is alſo diſcoverable by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a little powder of Gall to i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <note place="margin">Its nature.</note>Nor let any ſtartle at this aſſertion, that I affirm this <hi>Spaw</hi> water to be cold and moiſt, and alſo hot &amp; dry, which are contrary qualities, ſince it

Who knows not that wine, though it be cold &amp; moiſt actually, yet is po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentially hot &amp; dry, the ordinary uſe whereof doth heat &amp; dry the body.</p>
               <p>Now as all bodies incline to a pree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominancy of theſe four qualities, and moſt diſeaſes conſiſt in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of ſome one or more of them, each quality ſo exceeding is tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered by its contrary in the water, ſo as nature, which is ever ſollicitous for its own preſervation, cloſes with thoſe qualities in the water (as alſo in all other remedies) which correct its own exceſs, and arms it ſelf (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be very feeble) againſt thoſe other qualities that might increaſe its malady, &amp; hence it is, as D. <hi>French</hi> well obſerves, that a diſtemper will rather be altered by its contrary, then increaſed by its like.</p>

               <p>But as for ſuch as find ſome decay of their health, by reaſon of ſome diſtemper hanging on them, there may be need of preparation, and that with reference to the nature of the malady, whether ſimple or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated, the parts principally affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, the age and conſtitution of the Patient, the time of the diſeaſe whether in its growth, height, or declination, and the time of the year,<note place="margin">The fickly muſt take advice.</note> all which are conſiderable.

Star to hinder the working of Phyſick, while he that knew the reſt as well as this, never mentions them at all, which if they were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved would imply the unfitneſſe of every ſeaſon, and conſequently very few days in the year would be proper for Phyſick.</p>
               <p>It was indeed the heat of the weather which hee reſpected, which happens with us about the Coſmicall riſing of the Dog Star with the Sun, to wit,<note place="margin">Phyfick may be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the Dog days.</note> towards the later end of <hi>July.</hi> But neither is the heat ſo intenſe in this our climate, as that for it we ſhould abſtain from uſing remedies when there is need,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:116020:126"/>our <hi>July</hi> and <hi>Auguſt</hi> not being ſo hot as <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May</hi> are in the Iſland of <hi>Coos,</hi> (which is called in Maps <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,</hi> and by its owners <hi>Turks Stance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> not far from <hi>Rhodes</hi>) where <hi>Hippocrates</hi> lived. Now although nothing is more neceſſary to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by Phyſicians then the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, riſing and ſetting of eminent Stars, the bodies and ſtomacks of men receiving mutation accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their motions, to which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect is heedfully to be had in giving of Phyſick,<note place="margin">De aerc in principio.</note> as ſaith <hi>Hippocrates</hi> elſe where; yet there is not ſo much regard to be had, as that either this Star or the heat ſhould make us wholly abſtain, when a diſeaſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires it. Learned Phyſicians know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well enough how to muz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zle that Dog, and temper the heat with medicines ſutable, we having purging remedies as fit for hot weather as for cold and
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:116020:126"/>temperate, ſuch as if <hi>Hippocrates</hi> had known, I verily think hee had never mentioned that Aphoriſme; his purging medicines being exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hot, violent, and of a malignant and coroding nature, which wee have very rarely any occaſion to uſe (and then every better corrected) and do wholly lay aſide in the heat of Summer.</p>
               <p>Neither is <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoriſm laying down rules for gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of Phyſick, but only reporting his obſervation concerning the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of working of medicines, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi>h he ſays, is with ſome difficulty and bad Symptomes, &amp; well might it be ſo w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>h his medicines in that Climate; but what is that to us, while our own obſervations are, that ours do ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate without any difficulty; And whoſoever ſhal obſerve the operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of medicines in the hand of any able Phyſician at this time of the<note place="margin">Withgood ſucceſs.</note>

And more particularly this is found true in Mineral waters, ſuch as I am now treating of, which are (as I ſaid) the beſt in hot weather, both in regard of their more eminent participati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſtrength of the Minerals; as alſo becauſe of our bodies, which are more open and free for their paſſage; and we can alſo drink more plentifully in the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer moneths, which is neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be done by ſuch as go to the <hi>Spaws.</hi> It any require further ſatisfaction concerning this point of the <hi>Dog-dayes,</hi> I referre him to Dr <hi>Primeroſe</hi> his Book of <hi>Popular Errors:</hi>

                  </label> It is the beſt when it is drunk at the Fountain, for I think ſome of its Spirits do evaporate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing carried far, it ſeeming to have a purer azure colour, and a more acid taſte alſo at the Fountain; yet it may be carried many miles with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:116020:128"/>out any ſenſible decay of its ſtrength and operation, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly brought by the Fiſhermen in Caggs,<note place="margin">It hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo been car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed to <hi>London,</hi> and was found good</note> as far as <hi>York,</hi> and <hi>Hull,</hi> which is thirty miles, yea often ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny miles further. It hath alſo been carried to <hi>London,</hi> and was found good: I have drunk of it after it had been ten days in the Cagge, and have always found it to work very well; and I think if it were filled at the Fountain into Bottles, and well ſtopped, it would keep its vertue and ſweetneſs much longer, being ſet in Sand or Earth in a cold Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and might be carried perhaps as far as the <hi>German.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs, I think it much better to drink it at <hi>Scarbrough,</hi> for thoſe that are able of body to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel thither, and in purſe; eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for Students, who being here withdrawn from their Books, and all occaſions of Study (then which
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:116020:128"/>nothing is more prejudicial to ſuch as drink waters, or purſue any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther courſe of Phyſick) may enjoy the ſociety of their acquaintance, and lead a more chearfull &amp; active life, which will help to refreſh their ſpirits, and promote the more ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy paſſage of the water. But as for ſuch as through feebleneſs of body or eſtate, are not able to travel,<note place="margin">It may be carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad.</note> they may get it brought to them into the Country, having been incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged to the uſe of it by ſome able Phyſician, and they need not doubt its operation, it being impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not only with the ſpirits of the Minerals, which being carried far are ſubject to evaporation, but with the ſubſtance of them, or concrete juyce, which will continue as long as the Water it ſelf remaines ſweet.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Compared with the Germane.</note>And this ſeems to be of like nature with the principal <hi>Spaw,</hi> in
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:116020:129"/>
                  <hi>Germany,</hi> called by the name of <hi>Powhont,</hi> which is wont to be carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into ſeveral Countries, and was brought into <hi>England</hi> to Count <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemont,</hi> when he was ſent Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor from <hi>France</hi> to King <hi>James,</hi> and was found as good as at the Fountain, which might well be ſuppoſed to be done in leſs then ten days. And they both ariſe out of the bottom of a great Rock, having imbibed almoſt the very ſame Minerals, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I think this has no lead, and I ſuppoſe is not the worſe for it, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving alſo more ſtrength of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals then the <hi>Powhont:</hi> For when Doctor <hi>Paddy</hi> our Countrymen, and Doctor <hi>Heers</hi> diſtilled it, they found nothing but Rubrich, Ocher and a little Vitriol, as Doctor <hi>Heers</hi> himſelf relates, whereas three quarts of this affords, when the Rubrick is ſeparated from it, well nigh two drams of other Minerals.</p>
               <pb n="249" facs="tcp:116020:129"/>
               <p>The other which they call <hi>Sau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venir</hi> partakes much of the ſpirits of the Minerals, but hath very little of their juyce or ſubſtance, ſo as it is good at the Fountain, but looſes its ſpirits and vertue being carried abroad, in as much as <hi>Frambeſarius</hi> after two days journey found it like common water, whereas that of <hi>Powhont</hi> was ſtrong and quick.</p>
               <p>There are two other <hi>Spaws</hi> in <hi>Germany</hi> not long ſince diſcovered, <hi>viz. Geronſter</hi> and <hi>Tonnelet,</hi> but they are ſhort of the other in vertue: the former cauſing vomit often, and dizzyneſs in the head, as if a man were drunk; and the other muddy, and ſlimy, and nauſeous to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, yet they do each of them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo purge the belly. Theſe do the inhabitants of the Towns neer ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining make uſe of inwardly, both for the preparing of their meat and drink, as ordinary water, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:116020:130"/>the two firſt, and its obſerved by the <hi>German</hi> Writers , that in no place of <hi>Germany</hi> are there to be found older, and more healthfull people, then thereabouts.</p>
               <p>It is obſervable that the Stones by which this water paſſes at the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains (as alſo in all other <hi>Spaws</hi> I read of) are of a reddiſh colour; as alſo it turns the execrements of ſuch as drink of it into a ſad green or blackiſh colour, both which Doctor <hi>Heers</hi> thinks to proceed from Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick or <hi>mater ferri,</hi> becauſe all chalybeat Medicines after what manner ſoever they be taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly do the like.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cap.</hi> 8. <hi>p.</hi> 79.</note> But Doctor <hi>French,</hi> though he grants Iron may and doth cauſe a black tincture, yet he ſeems rather to impute it to the Vitrioll. For better ſatisfaction in this ſcruple both to my ſelf and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, I made a ſeparation of the Rubrick from the teſt of the Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:116020:130"/>with gall, and drank the clear water, which though I find it purges not a whit the leſs, yet the excreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were not changed at all, which is an experiment obſerved by nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them, ſo as it plainly appears that change of color proceeds from the Rubrick or Iron. And I alſo think it is the colour which receives the Tincture, which if it be awant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the excrements are not tinged at all: as in thoſe that have the Jaunders, whoſe Choler by reaſon of obſtructions doth not paſſe into the guts, they do find their excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments black, till after they have drunk a day or two, the obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons begin to open, and the choler is ſent down into the bowells. So al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo they that tarry long at the waters obſerve their excrements that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were blackiſh, to become more pale, which ariſes from the greateſt part of the choler which hath been
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:116020:131"/>purged away, except what is daily generated, which being but little cannot give ſo deep a tincture.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Leave off by degrees</note>My advice to them that drink long of it is, that they leave by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees as they began, taking a leſſe quantity every day then other for two or three days, and to purge wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try humours, as ſoon as they have done, either at <hi>Scarbrough,</hi> or when they come at home,</p>
               <p>It any after the uſe there of, find a watry moyſture upon his ſtomack more then ordinary,<note place="margin">Wine and Water cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect each other.</note> or ſome other moyſt diſtemper, which happens to thoſe whoſe ſtomacks and conce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive faculty are feeble, it may eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be corrected by drinking a glaſſe or two of Wine more then ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry at meals, for ſome little while, Wine and water fitly amending the diſtempers that proceed from a more then uſual drinking of each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as <hi>Herilacus</hi> obſerves well,<note place="margin">De vinor qd effect <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> ſo
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:116020:131"/>as he that is inflamed with Wine may be cooled with water, and all cold diſtempers that come by the immoderate uſe of water, may bee amended with Wine.</p>
               <p>And whereas perhaps there may be ſome that think it an empiricall thing, and to exceed belief, that this <hi>Spaw</hi> water ſhould cure ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny maladies, as I have reckoned up, and ſeverall of them of contrary qualities, I refer ſuch to the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of <hi>Fallowpius, Solenander, Gerin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus, Ryetius, Bezanſonius, H. ab Heers,</hi> who have treated of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Germany,</hi> and elſe where; as alſo to ſeveral of our own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try men, as Dr. <hi>Dean,</hi> Mr. <hi>Stanhope,</hi> Dr. <hi>Fiend,</hi> and many others, who have writ of ſeverall <hi>Spaws</hi> in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> moreover let them inform themſelves well, concernig the cures that have been done by the waters at <hi>Epſam, Tunbridge,
